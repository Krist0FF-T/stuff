## SuperMuki (feb)
![image](https://github.com/Krist0FF-T/stuff/blob/main/readme_assets/supermuki.png)
A simple 2D platformer game written in Python using the PyGame library.
Mainly written in february, but small modifications were made since then.
No longer in development, due to its successor, [SuperMupla](https://github.com/Krist0FF-T/supermupla).
More info, screenshots and videos can be found in the [repo](https://github.com/Krist0FF-T/supermuki)
